I am a postgraduate student at University College London, pursuing a [Master's degree in Machine Learning](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/machine-learning-msc). I am advised by [Professor Laura Toni](https://lasp-ucl.github.io/author/laura-toni/) and [Professor Brooks Paige](https://tbrx.github.io/). My thesis project was on studying the negative effects of the DropEdge algorithm on over-squashing in GNNs, demonstrating its unsuitability at modelling long-range interactions.

Previously, I earned a [Bachelor's degree in Mathematical and Computer Sciences](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/education/undergraduate-programme/bachelor-of-science-in-mathematical-and-computer-sciences) from Nanyang Technological University, supervised by [Professor Bryan Low](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lowkh/) at National University of Singapore. My thesis project introduced EV-GP, an active learning criterion with initialization robustness guarantees, for efficient learning under a low budget for data collection.

I spent the summer between the two programs working under the supervision of [Professor Xu Hong](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/xuhong/) and [Liu Fang](https://www.suss.edu.sg/about-suss/faculty-and-staff/detail/liu-fang). We introduced LingML, an efficient way of incorporating linguistic knowledge into LLMs, that performs competitively with state-of-the-art approaches at a fraction of computational cost.
