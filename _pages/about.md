I am a postgraduate student at University College London, pursuing a Master's in Machine Learning. I am advised by Professor Laura Toni and Professor Brooks Paige. Previously, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Mathematical and Computer Sciences from Nanyang Technological University, supervised by Professor Bryan Low at National University of Singapore. I spent the summer between the two programs at the Visual and Cognitive Neuroscience Lab at NTU, working under the supervision of Professor Xu Hong and Liu Fang.
