excerpt: 'Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a class of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that propagate information across the graph via local neighborhoods. The scheme gives rise to two key challenges: over-smoothing and over-squashing. While several Dropout-style algorithms, such as DropEdge and DropMessage, have successfully addressed over-smoothing, their impact on over-squashing remains largely unexplored. This represents a critical gap in the literature, as failure to mitigate over-squashing would make these methods unsuitable for long-range tasks &ndash; the intended use case of deep MPNNs. In this work, we study the aforementioned algorithms, and closely related edge-dropping algorithms &ndash; DropNode, DropAgg and DropGNN &ndash; in the context of over-squashing. We present theoretical results showing that DropEdge-variants reduce sensitivity between distant nodes, limiting their suitability for long-range tasks. To address this, we introduce DropSens, a sensitivity-aware variant of DropEdge that explicitly controls the proportion of information lost due to edge-dropping, thereby increasing sensitivity to distant nodes despite dropping the same number of edges. Our experiments on long-range synthetic and real-world datasets confirm the predicted limitations of existing edge-dropping and feature-dropping methods. Moreover, DropSens consistently outperforms graph rewiring techniques designed to mitigate over-squashing, suggesting that simple, targeted modifications can substantially improve a model's ability to capture long-range interactions. Our conclusions highlight the need to re-evaluate and re-design existing methods for training deep GNNs, with a renewed focus on modelling long-range interactions.'
