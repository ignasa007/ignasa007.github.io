I am a postgraduate student at **University College London**, pursuing a **Master's degree in Machine Learning**. I am advised by **Professor Laura Toni** and **Professor Brooks Paige**. My [thesis project](https://ignasa007.github.io/files/bsc-thesis_jasraj-singh.pdf) was on studying the negative effects of the DropEdge algorithm on over-squashing in GNNs, demonstrating its unsuitability at modelling long-range interactions.

Previously, I earned a **Bachelor's degree in Mathematical and Computer Sciences** from **Nanyang Technological University**, supervised by **Professor Bryan Low** at National University of Singapore. My [thesis project](https://ignasa007.github.io/files/msc-thesis_jasraj-singh.pdf) introduced *Expected Variance with Gaussian Processes* (EV-GP), an active learning criterion based on the NTK theory, with initialization robustness guarantees.

I spent the summer between the two programs working under the supervision of **Professor Xu Hong** and **Liu Fang** at the **Visual and Cognitive Neuroscience Lab**. We introduced *LingML*, an efficient way of incorporating linguistic knowledge into LLMs, that performs competitively with state-of-the-art approaches at a fraction of computational cost.
